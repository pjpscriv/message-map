      This is a tool that helps you explore and visualize your own Facebook Messenger History.

  <h1 mat-dialog-title>What am I seeing?</h1>
  <div>
    <p>
      In the central pane, you can see all your messages. Horizontally you've got the date,
      and vertically the time of day. Each dot represents a message that you sent or received.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can zoom in on this
    </p>
    <p class="with-icon">
      If you click the <mat-icon [color]="'primary'">menu</mat-icon> it will open a list of your chats
    </p>
    <p>
      On the right side of the screen, there are a bunch of histograms. These histograms give
      you statistics about your messages (number of messsages sent, most active conversation, etc..),
      but more interestingly, <mat-icon [color]="'primary'">filter_list</mat-icon> they allow you to filter your analysis. If you click on a bar, you
      can keep only the messages corresponding to this attribute, and all the other graphs will
      update automatically. This way, you can analyse for example who sends more messages in a
      particular conversation. Or what conversations are more active on the weekend versus during the week.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, if you mouse over the dots in the central pane, you can see
      the content of each message in the bottom right-hand corner of your screen.

      The data displayed behind this window is random data. Do some tests to understand
      how it works, then click on "Explore your own data" to play with your messages.
